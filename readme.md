## ECON G6905: Topics in Trade

Jonathan Dingel\
Columbia University\
Fall 2023

This graduate course covers topics in international trade and spatial economics.
We will extensively cover the methods use to estimate, calibrate, simulate, and solve quantitative trade and spatial models.
The topics covered will include estimating gravity regressions with high-dimensional fixed effects, computing counterfactual outcomes by exact hat algebra, choosing and implementing numerical solution methods, and conducting Monte Carlo simulations.
This class is designed to complement the trade and spatial subjects covered by David Weinstein in GR6903 and Donald Davis in GR6910.

### Assessment

Grades will be based on assignments (70%) and a final exam (30%).

### Computation

Scientific computation is important.
I hope that you have already been exposed to the basics.
Please glance at Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde's "[Computational Methods for Economists](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~jesusfv/teaching.html)" course.
My workflow is outlined in my [project template](https://github.com/jdingel/projecttemplate).

You have choices to make.
See "[A Comparison of Programming Languages in
Economics](https://github.com/jesusfv/Comparison-Programming-Languages-Economics)."
[I recommend](https://tradediversion.net/2018/09/17/why-i-encourage-econ-phd-students-to-learn-julia/)
the [Julia language](http://www.julialang.org).
Julia's advantages are that it is open source and typically faster than Matlab.
To get started doing economics in Julia, see Perla, Sargent, and Stachurski's
"[Lectures in Quantitative Economics](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)."
You may submit Julia or Matlab code as homework solutions.
Please confer with me before submitting code written in other languages.

Standards for transparency and replicability are rising quickly.
The AEA has appointed a [Data Editor](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/) who will verify that code works [prior](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) to accepting papers for publication.
Please write code for this class that is transparent and self-contained.
